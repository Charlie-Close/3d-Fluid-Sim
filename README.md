# 3d-Fluid-Sim
A 3d fluid simulation using OpenGl. Takes in an stl file as the object to map airflow around. Runs for a while to gather data, and then displays the airflow around the object, and a overall drag vector, representing the downforce to drag ratio. Press p to pause the simulation and boost frame rate.
